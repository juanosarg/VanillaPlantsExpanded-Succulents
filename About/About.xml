	<description>Vanilla Plants Expanded - Succulents is an optional module for Vanilla Plants Expanded adding a variety of decorative plants, ideal to make your bases, houses, workstations and hospitals much prettier without having to maintain the flowerbeds. Succulents might provide only half of the beauty that flowers normally do, but their lifespan is three times as long, meaning your colonists won’t be forever busy with replacing flowers every few days.

Succulents are inspired by real life succulents I have around my house, but for the purpose of the gameplay they have been unified stat-wise and simplified.

This mod has been made by me and my girlfriend so you better watch your words! No one dare declare their love to me this time.

I hope you will enjoy the mod, don’t hesitate to let me know what you think!
